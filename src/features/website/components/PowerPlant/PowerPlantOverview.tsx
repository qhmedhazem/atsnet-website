            Egypt's First Step Towards Sustainable Nuclear Energy
          </h1>
          <p className="text-lg">
            El-Dabaa Nuclear Power Plant, located in the El-Dabaa region on
            Egypt’s Mediterranean coast, is Egypt’s first nuclear power
            facility. The project, developed in collaboration with Russia, is a
            key part of Egypt's efforts to diversify its energy sources and meet
            growing electricity demands. The plant will feature four reactors
            with a total capacity of 4,800 megawatts, designed to provide a
            stable and sustainable energy supply. The construction of the first
            reactor began in 2021, and it is expected to become operational by
            2028. Upon completion, El-Dabaa will play a crucial role in Egypt’s
            transition to nuclear energy, contributing significantly to the
            nation’s power grid and economic development.
